  "readme": "# decorators\r\n\r\nThis package defines a conservative set of decorators intended for use in both\r\nNodeJS and web browser projects.  We recognize that decorators have certain risks:\r\n\r\n- They can inject hidden code at runtime, causing confusion for developers who\r\n  expected the source code to follow conventional semantics\r\n\r\n- They can be difficult to debug, since decorators are evaluated at load time\r\n  (versus compile time or run time)\r\n  \r\n- They can affect API contracts in subtle ways, which may cause unforeseen\r\n  breaks for runtime versioning (e.g. when loading a subclass that was compiled\r\n  against an older version of a base class with decorators)\r\n\r\n- The decorator spec is still evolving, and there may be breaking changes\r\n  in the future\r\n\r\nIn this light, the **@microsoft/decorators** package provides a small set of\r\ndecorators that stay within the conventional semantics of the TypeScript language.\r\nThe intent is to document API contracts more clearly and catch common mistakes,\r\nNOT to provide an open-ended toolkit of creative macros.  (If you are looking\r\nfor that, there are many other options, for example the\r\n[core-decorators](https://www.npmjs.com/package/core-decorators) project.)\r\n\r\n\r\n*This package is part of the [SharePoint Framework](http://aka.ms/spfx),\r\nwhich is a collection of NPM packages that empower developers to create client-side experiences\r\nfor [Microsoft SharePoint](https://products.office.com/en-us/sharepoint/collaboration).\r\nFor more information, including complete API documentation and code samples, please visit\r\nthe [SharePoint Framework](http://aka.ms/spfx) web site.*\r\n",
